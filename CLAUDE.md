# CLAUDE.md - Project Log

## STATUS: PRODUCTION-READY ACADEMIC BIBLIOGRAPHIC API

**Updated**: 2025-09-05  
**Session**: Sphinx Full Reindex Implementation and Daily Automation

### CURRENT SESSION WORK COMPLETED

#### 1. SPHINX FULL REINDEX AUTOMATION

**Complete Reindex System Implementation**:
- **Script Creation**: `/home/server/api_v2/scripts/sphinx-full-reindex.sh` - Full index rebuild with --all flag
- **Cron Automation**: Daily execution at 5:00 AM configured via crontab
- **Lock Mechanism**: Process locking prevents concurrent executions
- **Log Management**: Automatic 7-day log rotation in `/home/server/api_v2/logs/`

**Index Status and Performance**:
- **works_poc**: 4,744 records indexed successfully
- **persons_poc**: 549,459 records indexed successfully  
- **organizations_poc**: 182,174 records indexed successfully
- **venues_metrics_poc**: 4,945 records indexed successfully
- **signatures_poc**: Disabled (empty signatures table - requires data population)

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Execution Time**: ~30 seconds for complete rebuild of all indexes
- **Error Handling**: Automatic error counting and email alerts on failures
- **Verification**: Post-index record count validation for each index
- **Fallback**: Script continues even if searchd is not running
