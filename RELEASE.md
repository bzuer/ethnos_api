## AI Utilization Transparency

### Development Methodology
This project employed a multi-model AI strategy with Anthropic Claude serving as primary development assistant for complex code implementation and algorithmic problem-solving. Google Gemini provided architectural research validation, while DeepSeek Chat and xAI Grok assisted with code generation and ideation respectively.

### Human Oversight Protocol
All AI-generated output underwent rigorous validation including critical analysis for correctness, manual security audits, comprehensive testing with 85%+ coverage, and performance benchmarking under production-like conditions. The human developer retains full accountability for architectural decisions, business logic, and final implementation.
